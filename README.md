# MERN Stack Survey Platform

## üìå Introduction

This documentation outlines the development, structure, and functionality of a full-stack survey platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The primary objective of this platform is to provide administrators with a seamless interface to create customer surveys, collect valuable feedback, and guide users to leave online reviews.

The application streamlines the survey process with features such as authentication, input validation, CAPTCHA protection, and integration with Google Maps. The platform is designed to be accessible, intuitive, and efficient for both staff members and survey respondents.
